# Badge

Ho do you like this project so far? If this project is useful to you, please consider giving it a star on GitHub, sharing it with others and add a badge with a link to this project in your README (similar to the banner).

You can use the banner in the [GitHub URL (SVG)](assets\images\badges\UI.WPF.Modern_Badge.svg)

- iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern Built-in: ...

## Markdown Code

For example, in the README of your project, you can add the following markdown code:

```markdown
<a href="https://docs.inkore.net/ui-wpf-modern/introduction">
  <img src="https://github.com/iNKORE-NET/UI.WPF.Modern/blob/main/assets/images/badges/UI.WPF.Modern_Badge.svg?raw=true">
</a>
```

This will display the following badge:

<a href="https://docs.inkore.net/ui-wpf-modern/introduction">
  <img src="https://github.com/iNKORE-NET/UI.WPF.Modern/blob/main/assets/images/badges/UI.WPF.Modern_Badge.svg?raw=true">
</a>

## WPF Code

In your WPF application, you can use the `...` attached property to display the banner:

```xml

```

## Remarks

We strongly recommend you to add the badge image as a LINK in your project, instead of downloading the image and adding it to your repository. This way, you will always have the latest version of the badge.

The built-in badge URI is only available in the 0.10.0 version of the library and later.
